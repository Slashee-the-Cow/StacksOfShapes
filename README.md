# Stacks of Shapes
A cornucopia of delightful things to add to your scene! Not only do we have 3D objects (mostly based on geometry) but we also have 2D shapes extruded you can add to your print for the finishing touch.

## 3D
You want some basic shapes to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some slightly less than basic shapes to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some geometrical shapes you've probably never heard of to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some things which are based on geometrical things but probably aren't a thing? **We got them.**
## 2D
You want some common symbols anyone should be able to identify? **We got them.**  
You want some less common symbols people will have to think about for a minute? **We got them.**  
You want more of some kind of things than anyone should need? **We got them.**  
You want some symbols that you didn't realise you wanted until you see them? **We got them.**  
You want some things that make you think "why would anyone want to print that"? **We got them.**

### Known Issues
- In some older versions of Cura, some shapes may load partway through the floor or slightly in the air. This is due to not having the "drop down model" setting available in newer versions. I intend to fix it where I see it.
- My grasp of geometry is not nearly as good as it should be for someone making a plugin like this. If anything is wrong, please let me know.

### Do you make shapes?
**We want them.** Just post your idea on the discussions board and give me your pitch. Just a few rules:
1. 3D shapes have be based on geometric primitives, with occasional exceptions allowed. This isn't supposed to be "[Thingiverse](https://www,thingiverse.com): Plugin Edition".
1. Don't even come close to anything copyrighted.
1. It has to be your own work. If you find something out there feel free to point it out, but depending on licencing I can't just add *anything* to the plugin.
1. I'm looking for collections. If you have a really, really cool single thing I'll consider it though.
1. You have to share the files for whatever program you made them in as well as the STLs.
