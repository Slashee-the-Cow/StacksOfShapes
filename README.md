# Stacks of Shapes
A cornucopia of delightful things to add to your scene! Not only do we have 3D objects (mostly based on geometry) but we also have 2D shapes extruded you can add to your print for the finishing touch.

## 3D
You want some basic shapes to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some slightly less than basic shapes to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some geometrical shapes you've probably never heard of to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some things which are based on geometrical things but probably aren't a thing? **We got them.**
## 2D
You want some common symbols anyone should be able to identify? **We got them.**  
You want some less common symbols people will have to think about for a minute? **We got them.**  
You want more of some kind of things than anyone should need? **We got them.**  
You want some symbols that you didn't realise you wanted until you see them? **We got them.**  
You want some things that make you think "why would anyone want to print that"? **We got them.**

### Known Issues
- **Creating a shape temporarily disables automatic slicing for a few seconds. It may also briefly display an "Unable to slice" warning. This is to prevent a crash occuring due to Cura attempting to create a thumbnail before the graphics system loads because it can process such simple models so quickly.**
- In some older versions of Cura, some shapes may load partway through the floor or slightly in the air. This is due to not having the "drop down model" setting available per model in newer versions. I intend to fix any models that exhibit this behaviour when I see them.
- My grasp of geometry is not nearly as good as it should be for someone making a plugin like this. If anything is wrong, please let me know.
- Holding certain combinations of modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) can lead to unexpected behaviour with tooltips in the shape list.

### Do you want shapes?
**I want to know.** I'm not (to the best of my or the guy next to me's knowledge) psychic, so I don't know what all you fine folks out there want. I'm happy to include shapes people are going to want... just open a thread on the discussions page and let me know!

### Do you make shapes?
**We want them.** Just post your idea on the discussions board and give me your pitch. Just a few rules:
1. 3D shapes should be based on geometric primitives, with occasional exceptions allowed. This isn't supposed to be "[Thingiverse](https://www.hingiverse.com): Plugin Edition".
1. Don't even come close to anything copyrighted.
1. It has to be your own work. If you find something out there feel free to point it out, but depending on licencing I can't just add *anything* to the plugin.
1. Keep the file sizes down. There is a maximum file size for plugins.
1. I'm mainly looking for collections. If you have a really, really cool one or two things I'll consider it though.
1. You have to share the files for whatever program you made them in as well as the STLs.
