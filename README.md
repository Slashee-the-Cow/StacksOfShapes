# Stacks of Shapes
A cornucopia of delightful things to add to your scene! Not only do we have 3D objects (mostly based on geometry) but we also have 2D symbols extruded you can add to your print for the finishing touch.

### Notice:
**In Cura versions older than 5.10, if you have automatic slicing turned on, it will be turned off while the shape window is open. This to avoid a bug in Cura that could cause a crash when adding a simple shape with auto slice turned on.**

## 3D
You want some basic shapes to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some slightly less than basic shapes to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some geometrical shapes you've probably never heard of to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some things which are based on geometrical things but probably aren't a thing? **We got them.**
## 2D
You want some common symbols anyone should be able to identify? **We got them.**  
You want some less common symbols people will have to think about for a minute? **We got them.**  
You want more of some kind of things than anyone should need? **We got them.**  
You want to 3D print emojis? **We got them.** But not anywhere near all of them... there's far too many of them.  
You want some symbols that you didn't realise you wanted until you see them? **We got them.**  
You want some things that make you think "why would anyone want to print that"? **We got them.**

### Known Issues
- In Cura versions 5.7.0-5.9.1, automatic slicing will be disabled if it is enabled. This is due to a bug in those versions which can cause an immediate crash when adding simple models to the scene.
- Some models may move when rotating due to the transform origin not being in the centre. *Definitely* working on this one.
- Some of the Symbols may load rotated the wrong way. I'm looking into it.
- Sometimes models will load slightly out of bounds. I've tried to fix it but without success. I'll try harder.
- Sometimes a warning will appear saying a model is invalid. I can't reliably replicate it, so if you can, tell me how!
- Rapidly clicking the tabs at the top of the window may cause incorrect data to be loaded.
- It's not quite ready for translation yet. If you want to translate it, let me know and I can make it ready.
- Holding certain combinations of modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) can lead to unexpected behaviour with tooltips in the shape list.

### Do you want shapes?
**I want to know.** I'm not (to the best of my or the guy next to me's knowledge) psychic, so I don't know what all you fine folks out there want. I'm happy to include shapes people are going to want... just open a thread on the discussions page and let me know!

### Do you make shapes (or symbols, I guess)?
**I want them.** Just post your idea on the discussions board and give me your pitch. Just a few rules:
1. 3D shapes should be based on geometric primitives, with occasional exceptions allowed. This isn't supposed to be "[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com): Plugin Edition".
1. Don't even come close to anything copyrighted.
1. It has to be your own work. If you find something out there feel free to point it out, but depending on licencing I can't just add *anything* to the plugin.
1. Keep the file sizes down. There is a maximum file size for plugins.
1. I'm mainly looking for collections. If you have a really, really cool one or two things I'll consider it though.
1. You have to share the files for whatever program you made them in as well as the STLs.
1. Your shapes will be subject to the licensing conditions mentioned below.
