# Stacks of Shapes
A cornucopia of delightful things to add to your scene! Not only do we have 3D objects (mostly based on simple geometric shapes) but we also have 2D symbols extruded you can add to your print for the finishing touch. Even if that touch is a broken heart.

### Notice:
**In Cura versions 5.7.0 - 5.9.1, if you have automatic slicing turned on, it will be turned off while the shape window is open. This to avoid [a bug in Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/issues/19904) that could cause a crash when adding a simple model with auto slice turned on.  
5.10.0-beta.1 is also subject to this bug however the built in version check will pass any version of 5.10 (as the final release will include a patch for it) so you'll have to disable it manually.**

## 3D
You want some basic shapes to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some slightly less than basic shapes to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some geometrical shapes you've probably never heard of to add to your scene? **We got them.**  
You want some things which are based on geometrical things but probably aren't a thing? **We got them.**
## 2D
You want some common symbols anyone should be able to identify? **We got them.**  
You want some less common symbols people will have to think about for a minute? **We got them.**  
You want more of some kind of things than anyone should need? **We got them.**  
You want to 3D print emojis? **We got them.** But not anywhere near all of them... there's far too many of them.  
You want some symbols that you didn't realise you wanted until you saw them? **We got them.**  
You want some things that make you think "why would anyone want to print that"? **We got them.**

### Known Issues
- In Cura versions 5.7.0-5.9.1, automatic slicing will be disabled if it is enabled. This is due to a bug in those versions which can cause an immediate crash when adding simple models to the scene.
  - 5.10.0-beta.1 is also affected by this bug however you will have to turn off auto slicing manually as the built in version check will pass any version of 5.10 (since the fix will be in the final release).
- Models all load in the centre, overlapping if you don't move them. Making them not overlap is hard if you don't want stuff you already have to be moved (i.e. I'm looking into ways do to that, but no promises).
- Rarely a warning will appear saying a model is invalid. I can't reliably replicate it, so if you can, tell me how!
- Rapidly clicking the tabs at the top of the window may cause incorrect data to be loaded.
- It's not quite ready for translation yet. If you want to translate it, let me know and I can make it ready.
- Holding certain combinations of modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift) can lead to unexpected behaviour with tooltips in the shape list.

### Do you want shapes (or symbols, I guess)?
**I want to know.** I'm not (to the best of my or the guy next to me's knowledge) psychic, so I don't know what all you fine folks out there want. I'm happy to include shapes people are going to want... just open a thread on the discussions page and let me know!

### Do you make shapes (or symbols, I guess)?
**I want them.** Just post your idea on the discussions board and give me your pitch. Just a few rules:
1. 3D shapes should be based on geometric primitives, with occasional exceptions allowed. This isn't supposed to be "[Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com): Plugin Edition".
1. Don't even come close to anything copyrighted.
1. It has to be your own work. If you find something out there feel free to point it out, but depending on licencing I can't just add *anything* to the plugin.
1. Keep the file sizes down. There is a maximum file size for plugins.
1. I'm mainly looking for collections. If you have a really, really cool one or two things I'll consider it though.
1. You have to share the files for whatever program you made them in as well as the STLs.
1. Your shapes will be subject to the licensing conditions mentioned below.
